# Hacker Challenge

## Instructions

* Get your parteners Mod 2 project GitHub repository url

* Clone the repository down, and launch their project

  * You will need to run `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` before you can start the server

* Open their project, and choose a specific page

* Open Dev Tools

* Use JavaScript to mutate the project in the most creative and outlandish ways you can imagine.

  * Keep in mind that you can change the css for any element by querying for that element, and then running, for example, `element.style.borderStyle = "solid"`

* Some fun ideas:

  * You can mess with fonts
  * You can add borders to random things
  * You can make the text funny colors
  * You can rotate random things

* Once you have fiddled to your hearts content, take a screen shot of the page and slack it to Josh & Scott.
